# Personal Blog and Learning Coding

Welcome to my personal blog and coding learning journey! This repository contains basic HTML pages for my blog and serves as a platform for me to explore and learn coding. Feel free to explore the content and code as I navigate through the exciting world of web development.

## Blog Structure

The blog is organized into different HTML pages, each representing a post or a section of interest. The structure of the blog is designed to be simple and easy to navigate, making it a perfect space for both personal reflection and showcasing my coding progress.

## Getting Started

To view the blog locally or make modifications, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog.git`
2. Open the HTML files in your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
3. Explore and modify the content to suit your preferences.
4. Open the HTML files in a web browser to see the changes.

## Learning Coding

This repository is also a space for learning coding, specifically HTML. Feel free to examine the code, experiment with modifications, and use it as a playground to enhance your coding skills. As you progress, consider branching out into other languages and frameworks to broaden your understanding of web development.
